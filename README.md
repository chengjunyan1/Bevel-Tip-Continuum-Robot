# Bevel Tip Continuum Robot 
Dynamical modeling for Bevel Tip Continuum Robot and a RRT* 3D Trajectory Planner

*by Cheng Jun-Yan*

**Prerequisite:** MATLAB

This repository contains a Dynamical Modeling for the Bevel Tip Continuum Robot and a 3D Trajectory Planner based on RRT* and their simulation runs on MATLAB I developed for the term project in WPI RBE501 Robot Dynamics. The project goal is to control a bevel tip continuum robot to reach a given target point while avoid obstacles in tissue. This is a team (2 students) project, the other team member is a ME student responsible for the trajectory tracking controller. *Please note that this repository do not show the whole project, it only shows my part in the project.* 

The Project Reports folder contains my part in the written final report, presentation ppt, and my voice recordings of the final presentation.

**The Dynamical Modeling method comes from:**

## How to use:

Just run beveltip.m to see the demo.

Modify CONFIG.m to change the simulation environment.

Modify drawTrajectory.m to run the curve simulation.
